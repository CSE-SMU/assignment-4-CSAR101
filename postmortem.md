## How difficult was this assignment?

It was pretty difficult at first since I had no idea where to begin. But after looking at a bunch of tutorials online, slowly got there. May have gone a little overboard, but found some neat tutorials and tried to use what I saw.

## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

Everything. Tutorials were very helpful and learned a lot more about Bootstrap.

## How could this assignment be improved?

I believe it was a good challenge as it is, very time consuming but doable. Finding and being able to use tutorials was definitely a positive.

## Any other comments?

Possibly recommend some tutorials to look at? Spent a good amount of time going through a bunch of tutorials.

Please note that if you can't run the index.html file, please use Apache and Chrome. That is how I got mine to work and if needed, will do live presentation.
